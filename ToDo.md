### Simple project TODO list

- [x] Once a ball selector is clicked, do not show selectors for that ball until a tile is placed to the field

- [ ] Add the "Die/Reincarnate" settings switch
- [ ] Process reincarnation on track forks

- [ ] Add ball eyes
- [ ] Add game save/load
- [ ] Add settings to the Home screen
