### Simple project TODO list

- [x] Cache ball radiuses and segment line widths (to do not multiply them by sideLen on render)
- [x] Cache tile corner screen coordinates (to do not multiple during the render)
- [x] Sort tile segments after planning tracks (to do not sort them during render)
- [x] Merge intent and selector classes together
- [x] Add field scrolling
- [x] After planning tracks, create the list of hanging selectors to render, sorted descending by the track step
- [x] Render the selectors
- [x] Hit test the selectors by the list of hanging selectors reversed to account for overlaps
- [x] After selector click, set the selector and replan tracks
- [ ] Once a ball selector is clicked, do not show selectors for that ball until a tile is placed to the field
- [ ] Add the tile-replacement moves
- [ ] After plcaing a tile, advance balls, kill collided ones and replan tracks
- [ ] Add the "Die/Reincarnate" settings switch
- [ ] Process reincarnation on track forks
- [ ] End game when no balls left
- [ ] Add the Chaos tile moves (0, 1, 2, controlled by settings). Chaos adds its tiles after the player tile, and only then balls advance.
- [ ] Add the Shredder line (controlled by settings)
- [ ] Add the player move suggestion
- [ ] Add blots
- [ ] Add ball eyes
- [ ] Add animations
- [ ] Add game save/load
